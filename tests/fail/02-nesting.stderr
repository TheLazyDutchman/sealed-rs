   = note: `T` is a "sealed trait", because to implement it you also need to implement `lets::attempt::some::nesting::__seal_t::Sealed`, which is not accessible; this is usually done to force you to use one of the provided types that already implement it
   = help: the following types implement the trait:
             A
             B
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `sealed` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
