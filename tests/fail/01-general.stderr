error[E0277]: the trait bound `C: Sealed` is not satisfied

   | ^^^^^^^^^ required by this bound in `T`
12 | trait T {}
   |       - required by a bound in this trait
   = note: `T` is a "sealed trait", because to implement it you also need to implement `__seal_t::Sealed`, which is not accessible; this is usually done to force you to use one of the provided types that already implement it
   = help: the following types implement the trait:
             A
             B
   = note: this error originates in the attribute macro `sealed` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
